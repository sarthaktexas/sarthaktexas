hey! i'm sarthak. i've been tinkering with things ever since i was a child. these days, my interests lie at the intersection of structural biochemistry and computationâ€”building workflows for cryo-em data processing, algorithmic modeling of biomolecules, and integrating computational methods into structure determination. you can try to contact me below if you do any of these.
